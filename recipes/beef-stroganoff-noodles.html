    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul id="text">
      <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ tbsp flour</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vodka (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups egg noodles</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream (plus more for serving)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp fresh sliced chives or green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol id="text">
      <li>
        Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms,
        season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn
        golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook,
        stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka
        and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water
        and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting
        lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again
        and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream.
        Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives
        if so desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
